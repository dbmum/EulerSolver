# Overview

As a software engineer I am always wanting to learn new things and increase the depth of my understanding. I also enjoy, as always, finding new and creative solutions to increasingly complex problems. This is a large reason why I made this program.

This program is inspired by Project Euler, where public increasingly difficult math problems are available to be solved. All of the problems are designed to be solved through some sort of algorithm that you create. I took some of the initial problems and solved them in C++.

In this project I wanted to learn C++ and also become more familiar with the visual studio IDE. I wanted to explore how C++ works especially in concern to data types and pointers.

# Future Work

* Add Inheritence to the program with all of the problems inheriting the Solve() function.
* Learn more about pointers and their practical uses to make my programs more eficcient.
* Explore more mathematical ways to improve efficiency in my solutions.
